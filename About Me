<h2>Hello</h2>
<p> My name is Ben Rodia, and I’m a second year Interactive Digital Media student at Drexel University. That’s pretty much my life right now. This mini-bio was made in preparation for my first web authoring course, so I have some “professional content(?)” to share somewhere on this page. So let’s talk about me! I hail from Levittown PA, in the suburbs of Philadelphia, where I live now. I wanted to stay close to home, for me and my parents’ sakes, but also get a large school experience with all of the pomp and circumstance; to my eventual overwhelming fatigue (it got better though).</p>

<p>Until recently I’ve been a small town kid with small aspirations in a very big city, however over the last year I’ve grown into my life considerably, mentally, socially, and emotionally. I came with nothing but good grades and a resolution to learn everything I need to succeed. I didn’t enter this institution with a firm grip or understanding of my field or career path, and my school career is thus far still fairly unrealized. What I do know is that if I were to look back, I might not recognize myself from 2014; the growth of my skillset has been magnitudinous, and confidence doubly so.</p>

<p>I have interests, skills, and hobbies. I like critical thinking and problem solving; I do it just for fun. I enjoy analysis, particularly of entertainment media, to the point where my friends fear watching movies with me, else I peek behind the preverbal curtain and ruin the façade of the thing. This aptitude manifests in my coursework in the form of an awareness of deconstruction and -accordingly- reconstruction of concepts. In the broad field of digital media, I gravitate towards design over coding and even art -which I originally thought would be my forte. For fun, I’m a pseudo-competitive gamer, my favorite ‘sport’ being Magic: the Gathering.</p>

<p>There isn’t a lot else to share about myself. Like I said before; school is basically my life right now. I'm just committed to getting through, and the rest will come. I don’t know if everyone feels this as noticeably, but the transition period from childhood to adult is like death and rebirth; you lose a lot in the process, and emerge a whole new kind of person, and I’m kind of… right in there, an undead. Never mind that sounds really lame please don’t listen to me.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is my web portfolio; I make websites, or apps, or something, probably definitely commissionably or professionally. I don’t have a resume right now, nor a pro logo. However, below is my official contact information, thank you! Enjoy!</p>
