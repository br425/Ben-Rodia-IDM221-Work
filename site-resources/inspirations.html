<li><p>Tapped Out is a Magic: the Gathering Database/Forum/Deckbuilder/Decktester. I use it primarily for the latter functions, but it is interesting in that all of its features are interlocked; it is at once a solo and colaborative experience. The ability to fiddle around in the deckbuilder is enough, but I can also get immediate feedback by allowing my lists on the public feed for review. My favorite aspect is the UI of the virtual playmat; the Interface is clean, fast, and most importantly: everything works (better than other sites). I don't care for the homepage and list feed as much; they're homogenous uninteresting, and difficult to sort through. Overall the design is muted, suble, and atmospheric, which suites the userbase.</p></li>

<li><h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/"  target="_blank">Youtube</a></h2></li>

<li><p>Why not? It's an emmense art and information hub, and accordingly one of my most used sites. Even though the design has had ups and downs throughout its evolution, I like where they are now. Specifically on the mobile App I like the mini-window-video feature that lets you scroll through unrelated videos, and the ability to flip sideways for fullscreen, not to mention YouTubeRed, which has really legitimate features... though the subscription is a bit much, even if understandable. They've nearly perfected preference optimization, and you can live in your YouTube 'bubble' forever if you want. The comment system is still not great, but most are trained just to avoid it at this point, which I don't begrudge. It also helped pioneer the up and coming media-fusion artform that is 360 degree video playback. I'm very excited, and I actually support Google in its journey to knowing and owning everything.</p></li>

<li><h2><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/benrodia" target="_blank">Tumblr</a></h2></li>

<li><p>Hmm... I actually never use this site aside from one of my classes that used it as our homework repository. But insular communities and bad reputation be damned, I'm impressed with its design. It's sleek, versatile, and stupidly simple; the polish drew me in at first glance, then I apriciated how you can post and recieve almost any easily transferred media format, then I was  amazed by the simplicity of posting, sharing, and snooping around other blogs. If you wanna talk about content preferences, this lets you form a near perfect seal between your feed and the entire outside world, which is both a boon and its bane (socially). So yeah, very powerful, very dangerous. I stay away, but apriciate the craftsmanship.</p></li>
